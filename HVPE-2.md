|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Beliefs or principles guiding personal behavior. | Systematic rules or codes for deciding what is right and wrong. | Principles that distinguish right from wrong. |
| **Source**             | Personal beliefs, culture, religion.      | Professional codes, societal norms.    | Cultural, societal, or innate beliefs.   |

### **4. Impression Formation and Management**

**Impression Formation and Management** refers to the process by which individuals form judgments and opinions about others based on various cues, and how they control or manage the way others perceive them. Let me explain each term in simple detail:

### 1. **Impression Formation**
   - **Definition**: Impression formation is the process by which we develop an understanding or an image of another person based on the information available to us. It involves how we perceive and interpret someone's behavior, appearance, and other external characteristics.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **First Impressions**: People tend to form quick judgments about others, especially in the first few moments of meeting them. These judgments can be influenced by appearance, body language, tone of voice, etc.
     - **Cognitive Biases**: Our impressions may be influenced by biases such as stereotyping, where we form judgments based on group characteristics rather than individual traits.
     - **Nonverbal Cues**: Body language, facial expressions, and gestures play a major role in forming impressions. For example, a friendly smile might create a positive impression.
     - **Context**: Impressions can also be shaped by the context in which a person is observed. For example, someone acting confidently in an interview may be seen as competent, while the same behavior in a casual setting might be interpreted differently.
   - **Example**: If someone meets a new person at a party and sees them smiling, shaking hands firmly, and maintaining eye contact, they may form a positive impression of them as friendly and confident.

### 2. **Impression Management**
   - **Definition**: Impression management refers to the conscious or unconscious efforts that individuals make to influence how others perceive them. It involves controlling the information others receive about you to create a desired image or impression.
   - **Key Points**:
     - **Self-Presentation**: Individuals use various strategies to present themselves in a favorable light. For example, in a job interview, a candidate may dress formally, speak confidently, and highlight their strengths to create a positive impression.
     - **Social Media**: In the digital age, impression management is also done through online platforms. People curate their social media profiles to present an idealized version of themselves, such as posting only positive images or achievements.
     - **Tactics**: Common impression management tactics include flattery, self-promotion, ingratiation (trying to make someone like you), and even playing down one’s weaknesses.
     - **Authenticity vs. Manipulation**: While impression management can be seen as manipulating the way others view you, it’s important to balance it with authenticity. Overdoing it can create a fake image that is easily detected, leading to mistrust.
   - **Example**: A candidate preparing for a job interview may practice responses to questions, dress according to the company culture, and choose words carefully to impress the interviewer.

### 3. **Impression Formation vs. Impression Management**
   - **Difference**: 
     - **Impression formation** is the natural process of forming an impression about someone, which happens passively through observing behaviors and cues.
     - **Impression management**, on the other hand, is an active effort to influence how others form impressions about you.
   - **Overlap**: Both are essential in social interactions and can influence relationships, whether personal or professional.

### **Where to Use Diagrams**
- **Flowchart**: To explain the process of **impression formation**, starting from the first encounter to the conclusion.
- **Venn Diagram**: To compare **impression formation** and **impression management**, showing the overlap in terms of social perception.

### **Importance of Impression Formation and Management**
- **Social Interactions**: How we form impressions influences our relationships, both in personal and professional settings.
- **Career Success**: People often use impression management in job interviews, promotions, and networking to secure opportunities.
- **Cultural Impact**: Different cultures may emphasize different elements of impression formation (e.g., eye contact in Western cultures vs. modesty in some Eastern cultures).

In conclusion, **impression formation and management** is a crucial skill in understanding how we perceive others and how we control how others perceive us, which can significantly impact our personal and professional lives.
