### **1. Overview of Machine Learning Concepts**  

**Definition**:  
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without human intervention. It uses statistical methods and algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in data.  

**Key Concepts**:  

- **Overfitting**:  
  Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and random patterns. As a result, the model performs exceptionally well on training data but poorly on unseen data.  

  - **Signs of Overfitting**:  
    - High accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data.  
    - Complex models with many parameters.  

  - **Solutions**:  
    - Simplify the model (reduce complexity).  
    - Use techniques like regularization (e.g., Lasso, Ridge).  
    - Collect more training data.  
    - Apply cross-validation to evaluate model performance.  

- **Train/Test Split**:  
  To assess the performance of machine learning models, data is divided into:  
  - **Training Data**: Used to train the model.  
  - **Testing Data**: Used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.  

  Typical ratios for splitting data include 70:30 or 80:20. This ensures that the model generalizes well to new inputs.

### **2. Types of Machine Learning**

Machine learning approaches are classified into three main types based on the kind of data and the task involved.

| **Type**                   | **Definition**                                                                                                   | **Characteristics**                                                                                           | **Applications**                                     |

### **3. Introduction to Bayes Theorem**

**Definition**:  
Bayes Theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of related conditions. It is foundational in probabilistic reasoning and machine learning.  

**Formula**:  
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]  

- **P(A|B)**: Probability of event A given event B is true.  
- **P(B|A)**: Probability of event B given event A is true.  
- **P(A)**: Prior probability of event A.  
- **P(B)**: Prior probability of event B.  

**Applications**:  
1. **Spam Detection**: Predicting whether an email is spam based on specific words.  
2. **Medical Diagnosis**: Estimating the probability of a disease given certain symptoms.  

**Example**: If 60% of patients with a symptom have a disease and the general prevalence of the disease is 10%, Bayes Theorem helps determine the likelihood a patient has the disease after observing the symptom.

### **4. Linear Regression**

**Definition**:  
Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors) as a straight line.  

**Equation**:  
\[
y = mx + c
\]  

- **y**: Dependent variable.  
- **x**: Independent variable.  
- **m**: Slope (coefficient of the independent variable).  
- **c**: Intercept.  

**Model Assumptions**:  
1. The relationship between predictors and the target is linear.  
2. Errors (residuals) are normally distributed.  
3. No multicollinearity among predictors.  
4. Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors).

**Regularization Techniques**:  
1. **Lasso (L1 Regularization)**: Shrinks some coefficients to zero, eliminating irrelevant features.  
2. **Ridge (L2 Regularization)**: Reduces the magnitude of coefficients without setting them to zero.  
3. **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties for feature selection and better prediction accuracy.

**Applications**:  
Predicting house prices, stock prices, and sales revenue.
