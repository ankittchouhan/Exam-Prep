# UNIT–I: Introduction to Data Science

### 1. What is data science, and how does it differ from traditional data analysis?

- **Data Science**: It involves extracting insights and knowledge from large and complex datasets using techniques like machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis.
- **Traditional Data Analysis**: Focuses more on analyzing structured data to find patterns using statistical tools.
- **Key Difference**: Data science works with both structured and unstructured data and uses advanced algorithms, while traditional analysis often focuses on smaller, structured datasets.

### 2. Explain the concept of big data and its key characteristics.

- **Big Data**: Refers to extremely large datasets that are difficult to process using traditional tools.
- **Key Characteristics (The 5 Vs)**:
  1. **Volume**: Huge amount of data.
  2. **Velocity**: Speed at which data is generated.
  3. **Variety**: Different types of data (text, images, videos).
  4. **Veracity**: Accuracy and reliability of the data.
  5. **Value**: Insights derived from data.

### 3. What are the key traits of Big Data?

- **Scalability**: Can grow with the amount of data.
- **Complexity**: Often involves unstructured and heterogeneous data.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Often needs to be processed quickly for decision-making.
- **Automation**: Requires advanced tools for efficient handling.

### 4. Describe the process of web scraping. How is it useful in data science?

- **Web Scraping**: The process of extracting data from websites using tools or scripts.
- **Steps**:
  1. Access the website.
  2. Identify the data to extract (e.g., HTML tags).
  3. Use tools like Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) to scrape the data.
  4. Store the extracted data for analysis.
- **Uses in Data Science**:
  - Collect large datasets from the web.
  - Gather real-time data for analysis.

### 5. What are some ethical considerations and legal issues associated with web scraping?

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Respect the website’s terms of service.
  - Avoid overloading the server (rate limiting).
- **Legal Issues**:
  - Violating copyright laws or data protection regulations.
  - Scraping without permission may lead to legal action.

### 6. Compare and contrast data analysis with data reporting.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Involves exploring and interpreting data to find patterns and insights.
  - Uses tools like Python, R, and Excel.
  - Example: Predicting sales trends.
- **Data Reporting**:
  - Presents analyzed data in a structured format, like charts or dashboards.
  - Focuses on communication rather than exploration.
  - Example: Monthly sales report.

### 7. What are some common tools and techniques used for data reporting?

- **Tools**:
  - Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio, Microsoft Excel.
- **Techniques**:
  - Dashboards for real-time updates.
  - Automated reporting using scripts.
  - Using visualizations like graphs and pie charts to simplify data.

### 8. What are some common data visualization techniques, and how are they used in Data Science?

- **Common Techniques**:
  - **Bar Charts**: Compare categories.
  - **Line Graphs**: Show trends over time.
  - **Pie Charts**: Display proportions.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Identify relationships between variables.
  - **Heatmaps**: Show data density or intensity.
- **Uses**:
  - Helps in understanding patterns and trends.
  - Communicates findings effectively to stakeholders.

### 9. What challenges are commonly faced in the analysis of big data?

- **Data Quality**: Handling incomplete or inconsistent data.
- **Storage**: Managing large volumes of data.
- **Processing Speed**: Analyzing data quickly.
- **Complexity**: Dealing with unstructured data.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensuring data protection and compliance with regulations.
